 * update-deployments implements the control flow and logic of how updates are
 * rolled out to deployments. The default implementation uses a sequential
 * one-at-a-time strategy, with a configurable error bucket size.
 *
 * As each deployments' pipeline is implemented using CDK Pipelines, they can each
 * self-mutate. This means that we simply need to trigger the pipelines to execute,
 * and they will each update themselves. The utility waits for the pipeline
 * execution to finish, before continuing with the new pipeline.
