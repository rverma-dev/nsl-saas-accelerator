 * This is the main CDK application for the sample solution.
 *
 * This CDK application has two modes of operation, and will synthesize a different
 * stack depending on the mode.
 *
 * Mode A: Synthesize the toolchain stack. This is the default mode.
 *         This is used during the initial deployment of the solution, and by
 *         the CI/CD Pipeline for synthesizing the stack during updates.
 *         No additional arguments are used.
 *
 * Mode B: In this mode, the application synthesizes a silo or pool workload pipeline
 *         stack. To operate in this mode, AWS CDK CLI is called with the following
 *         context variables (-c in the CLI)
 *
 *         deployment_type  : the type of deployment stack to create (silo|pool)
 *         deployment_id    : the deployment id (siloid|poolid)
 *         component_account: the AWS Account where the component resources for
 *                          : this deployment are deployed to
 *         component_region : the AWS Region, as above
